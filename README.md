W3.CSS RTL
=======
right-to-left languages support for W3.CSS framework

This project aims to add supporting RTL direction (for languages such as Persian, Arabic and Hebrew) to W3.CSS framework.
It only changes the predefined directions and alignments in framework. So it might be necessary to edit the original template and change `.w3-left` classes to `.w3-right` and vice versa depending on template.

.w3-ltr
=======
This class can be used for texts whom need to be in LTR direction. Like URLs, Emails, and so on.
